# Parkinson disease :

Parkinson's disease is a brain disorder that leads to shaking, stiffness, and difficulty with walking,
balance, and coordination.
Parkinson's symptoms usually begin gradually and get worse over time. As the disease progresses,
people may have difficulty walking and talking. They may also have mental and behavioral changes,
sleep problems, depression, memory difficulties, and fatigue.
Both men and women can have Parkinsonâ€™s
disease. However, the disease affects about
50 percent more men than women.

# Parkinson disease and machine learning :

Parkinson's disease (PD) patient care is limited by inadequate, sporadic symptom monitoring, infrequent
access to care, and sparse encounters with healthcare professionals leading to poor medical decision making
and sub-optimal patient health-related outcomes. More frequent patient monitoring and treatment
adjustments can lead to better symptomatic management and reduction in treatment-related complications
such as motor fluctuations.
