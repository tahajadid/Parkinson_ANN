# Parkinson disease :

Parkinson's disease is a brain disorder that leads to shaking, stiffness, and difficulty with walking,
balance, and coordination.
Parkinson's symptoms usually begin gradually and get worse over time. As the disease progresses,
people may have difficulty walking and talking. They may also have mental and behavioral changes,
sleep problems, depression, memory difficulties, and fatigue.
Both men and women can have Parkinsonâ€™s
disease. However, the disease affects about
50 percent more men than women.
